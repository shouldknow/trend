					<p class="text">As we age, our immune system begins to naturally decline. Thankfully, there are some things you can do to help combat this and boost your immune system, helping your body fight diseases. Keep reading to learn more about how to make your immune system stronger.<br><br>

7 Immune System Boosters and Tips
Eat immune-boosting foods. A healthy diet influences numerous benefits to mental and physical health, including an improved immune system. A balanced diet can help lead to proper nutrient and antioxidant intake, which will help give you an upper hand on harmful pathogens. Immune-boosting foods include citrus fruits, broccoli, ginger, almonds, shellfish and green tea.<br><br>
Consider supplements. Certain vitamins are proven to help your immune system fight off illness. Perhaps the biggest immune booster is vitamin C and, in fact, a lack of vitamin C can even make you prone to more illness. Other vitamins include B6 and E. As always, discuss with your doctor before adding supplements into your routine.
Maintain proper hygiene. Personal hygiene is how you care for your body. Good personal hygiene is important for numerous reasons, including stopping the spread of illnesses and disease and reducing your risk of medical conditions that result from poor personal hygiene. You can maintain good personal hygiene by washing your hands, bathing, taking care of your teeth and cleaning your clothes.<br><br>
Exercise regularly and maintain a healthy weight. By staying physically active and ensuring favorable weight, you’re doing a favor to both your mental and physical health, which leads to an improved immune system. The U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services recommends that most older adults participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity or an equivalent combination of each per week for substantial health benefits. And, be sure to talk to your doctor to establish your target weight range that offers optimal health.<br><br>
Get adequate sleep. Bedtime routines may differ from person to person, but the important thing is to find one that works for you and contributes to a good night’s sleep. Restful sleep is essential to wellbeing, no matter your age. Contrary to popular opinion, seniors don’t need less sleep than the average person – in fact, all adults need about seven to nine hours a night.<br><br>
Don’t smoke, and drink alcohol in moderation. Smoking and drinking in excess harms the immune system and can make the body less successful at fighting disease.
Stay away from stress. Stress can have many harmful effects on your body when not properly managed, especially when it comes to your immune health. In order to mitigate the damaging effects of stress, participate in calming activities, such as meditation and relaxation exercises.<br><br>
